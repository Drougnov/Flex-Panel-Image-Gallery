## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Thanks for cheking out this repository.

## What is it about

It's a image gallery made with flexbox and vanilla JS. I've been practicing basic javascript project from [wesbos's javascript 30 course](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/62adf09d8ed3995269d75c5a). This is the day5 project.

This project teaches(especially) you how to:

-sizing and aligning items with flexbox.

-call function when transition ends
